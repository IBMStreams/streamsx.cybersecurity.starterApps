# streamsx.cybersecurity.starterApps
Starter applications for IBM Streams cybersecurity toolkit

These sample applications are compatible with Streams 4.3 and later.
You can build and run the samples with local Streams or with Streams in Cloud Pak for Data.

For Streams 4.2 use version 1.0 of the samples: [https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.cybersecurity.starterApps/tree/v1.0.0](Samples for Streams 4.2)

## Quick Start

 1. Download or clone the git repository to your system
 2. Each application comes with a build.xml that will download necessary dependencies and compile the application
   - For the BWListTaggerSamples, DomainProfilingSamples, DNSTunnelingSamples and HostProfilingSamples application, run `ant`
   - For the PredictiveBlacklistingSamples application, run `ant -Dspss.toolkit.path=<path_to_spss_toolkit>`
 3. Submit the job! (the *.sab file can be found in the `output` directory)
