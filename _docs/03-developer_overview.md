## Quick Start

 1. Download or clone the git repository to your system
 2. Each application comes with a build.xml that will compile the application using local Streams
   - For the BWListTaggerSamples, DomainProfilingSamples, DNSTunnelingSamples and HostProfilingSamples application, run `ant`
   - For the PredictiveBlocklistingSamples application, run `ant -Dspss.toolkit.path=<path_to_spss_toolkit>`
 3. Submit the job! (the *.sab file can be found in the `output` directory)

### Cloud Pak for Data

To launch the samples (BWListTaggerSamples, DomainProfilingSamples, DNSTunnelingSamples, HostProfilingSamples) using [streamsx command line tools](https://streamsxtopology.readthedocs.io/en/stable/scripts/streamtool.html) to a remote Streams instance (Cloud Pak for Data),
run `ant buildAndSubmitRemote`
